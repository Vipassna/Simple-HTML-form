        <h3>Introducing Pure</h3>
     <h6> By Tilo Mitra under <button>CSS</button> <button>Pure</button></h6>   
     <p>Pure is ridiculously tiny. The entire set of modules clocks in at 3.7KB* minified and gzipped.
          Crafted with mobile devices in mind, it was important to us to keep our file sizes small, 
          and every line of CSS was carefully considered. 
          If you decide to only use a subset of these modules, you'll save even more bytes.
          Pure builds on Normalize.css and provides layout and styling for native HTML elements,
           plus the most common UI components. It's what you need, without the cruft.</p>

        <h3>Extend- Build on top of Pure</h3>
        <p>One of our goals when developing Pure was to make it extremely extensible.
             By including Pure and writing some CSS on top of it, you can ensure that your 
             site or app works across browsers, while looking truly unique. Best of all,
             your CSS file size will remain tiny, which is a great thing for mobile users 
             and others with slow connections.</p>
        <h3>Common Layouts</h3>
        <p>Pure was crafted with the goal that it can be used in every web project.
             To showcase this, we've made some common layouts that leverage Pure.
             These layouts are responsive and don't require JavaScript (except for certain menu interactions).
            </p>
        <h3>TOOLS - write, maipulate, and do more with CSS</h3>
        <p>Installing Pure with npm : <br>

            You can add Pure to your project through npm. 
            This is our recommended way to to integrate Pure into your
            project's build process and tool chain. <br>
            $ npm install purecss --save<br>
            require('purecss') will load an object with the following methods:<br>
            1. getFile(name) <br>
            2. – Retrieve contents of a Pure module file.<br>
            3. getFilePath(name)<br>
            4. – Return full path to a Pure file<br>

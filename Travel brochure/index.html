<h2><i>Top 5 places to visit</i></h2>
 <h3>Taj Mahal</h3>
 <p2>People from all around the world may not have heard of Agra,
      but everyone knows the beautiful ivory white-marble mausoleum, Taj Mahal, as the icon of love.
       This wonder of the world is the perfect example of the intricacy and brilliance of Persian and Mughal
        architecture.
         It was constructed by Emperor Shah Jahan, in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. 
         Today, the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and it continues to hold the same magical appeal, 
         attracting approximately eight million tourists a year.
          Viewing of the Taj Mahal is usually from sunrise to sunset, except Fridays.

  <h3>Fatehpur Sikri</h3>
  <p2>Fatehpur Sikri is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India.
       The city itself was founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, 
       serving this role from 1571 to 1585,
        when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was later completely abandoned in 1610.</p2><br>

   <h3>Mehtab Bagh</h3>
   <p2>Constructed just opposite the Taj Mahal, Mehtab bagh is a char-bagh (four garden) 
       complex that is considered the ultimate viewing point of the magnificent marble mausoleum.
        The garden is open from sunrise to sunset and is considered a photographer’s
         haven because it is the point from where you can take some unique photographs of 
         the Taj with a gorgeous backdrop.</p2>

    <h3>Kinari Bazar</h3>
    <p2>Located on the Agra-Fatehpur Sikri highway, 
        Korai village is home to people belonging to the Kalandhar tribe.
         A day trip to experience the kind of life they live will not only show you what rural life in
         India is like but will also give an inside feel of their simple lifestyle—their huts,
         how they cook their food, and how they drink water using a hand pump. 
         The people of this village now earn a livelihood through these day tours,
         as the money collected is used to purchase everyday items such as food, rations, 
         and stationary for the kids. These items are then equally distributed among the families.</p2>

    <h3>Agra fort</h3>
    <p2>Agra has one of the finest Mughal forts in India.
         This red sandstone and marble architecture exudes power and grandiosity.
          Agra fort was primarily begun by Emperor Akber in 1565 as a military structure and
           was later transformed into a palace by his grandson Emperor Shah Jahan. 
           Some of the most iconic structures in Mughal history are still a part of this fort, 
           such as Shish Mahal (Mirror Palace), 
          Diwan-e-aam (Hall of general audience) and Diwan-e-khaas (Hall of private audiences). 
          The Amar Singh gate, which was originally built to confuse attackers with its dogleg design,
           is now the sole point of entry to the fort.</p2><br>
